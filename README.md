# Vs-Sasha-Mod
Repository of the project for Vs Sasha

Hey Hey! It's Jakeneutron! Welcome to the read-me file of this here "Vs Sasha" mod! This is the first version of the mod, so it's pretty short and still has some things I want to add. But it's better to have something out at all then never!

This repository should house just about every project file I used EXCEPT Mixcraft and Logic Files... because those would pretty much be useless to most folks... especially the Logic X files. Hope you enjoy!

This repository was built off of KadeDev's Kade-Engine! Check out the latest version of his engine here:

ALSO ALSO ALSO: There is unused code for video in haxeflixel in the game, it doesn't work but it hasn't been removed yet:
Comes from this https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/openfl-haxeflixel-video-code
If you don't have the plugins i needed for VSC to read these files, it'll probably make compiling not work, so checkout the page to know what you need!
I'll try and remove these codes later on if able.
